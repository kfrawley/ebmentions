Avenay[^1], 29 October 1672

From the many appeals you’ve been making to get me back, I see quite clearly that I was mistaken in the suspicions I had of your lack of affection and esteem for me. I beg you to believe that the poor health I had in Rome had fed in me an aversion for that city which, increased by my inability to leave it, made me resolve to take such a grave course of action as to move away, at such great risk to myself. And since then, I have not behaved in a way that would merit reproach from anyone, nor have I deserved to be treated in such a way. When I left Grenoble,[^2] I had no other aim than to go to Paris to speak to the King, to see all my relatives, and then to enter

a convent in that city or not far from there. As I had no thought of seeing anyone but them, I have acted in keeping with that plan until now, and it should not seem odd to you that I would choose to stay in a city like Paris, since all my relatives are there and since I used to find there all manner of support, comfort, and convenience. The King, on the contrary, wanted to show you all possible courtesy, and so he has sent me to a desolate monastery thirty leagues from Paris, where I am in very poor health. If you will allow me a little freedom to follow my wishes, you will also find me ever ready to repay with my very blood the harm that you believe I may have caused.

[^1]: The Benedictine abbey of Avenay, which was founded in 660 CE, was completely destroyed during the Revolution. The village of Avenay-Val-d’Or where it was located is eighteen miles south of Reims.
[^2]: Marie left Grenoble in early August 1672, after having traveled in the company of her sister Hortense, Duchesse Mazarin, since they had fled together from Rome on 29 May 1672. They went their separate ways after Grenoble—Marie to “throw herself at the feet of the King” in Paris, and Hortense to take up residence in Chambéry as a guest of the Duke of Savoy, a former suitor of hers.
