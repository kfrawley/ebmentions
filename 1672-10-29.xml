                <p>From the many appeals youâ€™ve been making to get me back, I see quite clearly that I was mistaken in the suspicions I had of your lack of affection and esteem for me. I beg you to believe that the poor health I had in Rome had fed in me an aversion for that city which, increased by my inability to leave it, made me resolve to take such a grave course of action as to move away, at such great risk to me. And since then, I have not behaved in a way that would merit reproach from anyone, nor have I deserved to be treated in such a way. When I left <placeName>Grenoble</placeName>, I had no other aim than to go to <placeName>Paris</placeName> to speak to the <persName xml:id="louis-xiv">King</persName>, to see all my relatives, and then to enter</p>
                <p>a convent in that city or not far from there. As I had no thought of seeing anyone but them, I have acted in keeping with that plan until now, and it should not seem odd to you that I would choose to stay in a city like <placeName>Paris</placeName>, since all my relatives are there and since I used to find there all manner of support, comfort, and convenience. The <persName xml:id="louis-xiv">King</persName>, on the contrary, wanted to show you all possible courtesy, and so he has sent me to a desolate monastery thirty leagues from <placeName>Paris</placeName>, where I am in very poor health. If you will allow me a little freedom to follow my wishes, you will also find me ever ready to repay with my very blood the harm that you believe I may have caused.</p>
