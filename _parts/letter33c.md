[Don Maurizio](/people#bologna-maurizio]) has spoken to me and told me of the kindness you are showing toward me; but I keep on writing to you and thanking you for it, as I will always do so long as I know that my letters bring you pleasure. As for what you wish to know about the monastery I want, I would have liked to go directly from here to Paris, to an abbey. But since that does not meet with your approval, for now I will stay in the convent Du Lys{% include annotate.md id="c1673_08_04_mm2lc" no="3" %}, if they are willing to let me stay there; otherwise, in Lyon with the Ursulines in the rue Vieille-Monnaie. And in the meantime, you will make every effort to see that the [King](/people#louis-xiv]), as a favor to you, does not deny me this consolation of staying in a convent in Paris near

And since I can well imagine that it will take quite a lot of money to cover the expense of this journey, particularly if the [Marquis de Borgomanero](/people#borgomanero]) accompanies me as he says he would like to do, I think it well that, as you do not have a great deal of ready cash, you should see fit that thirty plots of land of my mountains be sold for this purpose. And you can have those funds transferred here to Don Maurizio, who will be able to come with me, if it pleases you that he serve me on your behalf, in order to administer to me in the convent in France the assistance that you are graciously providing now. And as I believe that to sell the thirty plots of land of my mountains, you will no doubt need my consent and authority, I give those to you by virtue of the present letter, so that using your authority in Rome, and according to my wishes here stated, you may order [Marcatelli](/people#marcatelli]) or whomever you wish, to sell them.

Maria Mancini Colonna

It is only to avoid displeasing you that I remain here, where I am reluctant to stay and with good reason. But as soon as you have a reply from the King, let me know so that the archbishop of whatever place will be able to give me permission to enter a monastery. Press for the money, too, and if the land cannot be sold that quickly, you can have it lent to me so that it can be transferred here right away to pay what I owe. And with that, I assure you that I am ever your
