madama-di-chalais,madama di Chalais,,"<p>Anne-Marie de La Trémouille (or Marie-Anne de La Trémoille), Princesse de Chalais (1642-1722), was married in 1657 to Adrien-Blaise de Talleyrand, Prince de Chalais, and was widowed in 1670 in Italy. She stayed in Italy, and in 1675 she married Flavio degli Orsini, Duke of Bracciano (1620-1698). After his death, she assumed the title of Princesse des Ursins, although it had no legal existence, and through her complicated political maneuvering, she managed to establish herself as camerera mayor to Marie-Louise Gabrielle of Savoy (granddaughter of Hortense's benefactor, Charles-Emmanuel II of Savoy), the thirteen-year-old bride of the young Spanish king, Philip V (who was himself the grandson of Louis XIV). From 1701 to 1714, the Princesse des Ursins was the most powerful figure in Spain, holding sway as she did over the young queen and through her, over the king.</p><p>However, Marie's reference here to the Princesse de Chalais is meant to point out the freedom which she claimed for herself as a young widow in Italy. And like the freedom that the Mancini sisters had appropriated, it was looked upon with disapproval by such contemporaries as Madame de Sévigné, who wrote in 1672: “Madame de Chalais is mad; that is how she is seen in this country. The fine idea of going from town to town, in Italy, like a hapless wretch of a princess, instead of coming back peacefully to Paris to her mother who adores her, and who counts among all the misfortunes of her family the extravagance of her daughter! She is right; I have never seen a more ridiculous one.” (« Mme de Chalais est folle; on la trouve telle en ce pays-ci. La belle pensée d'aller de ville en ville, en Italie, comme une princesse infortunée, au lieu de revenir à Paris paisiblement chez sa mère qui l'adore, et qui met au rang de tous les malheurs de sa maison l'extravagance de sa fille ! Elle a raison ; je n'en ai jamais vu une plus ridicule. ») Letter to Madame de Grignan dated April 20, 1672, Correspondance, I: 484.</p>",
