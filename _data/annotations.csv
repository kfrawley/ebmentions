'In faccia alla contessa' could conceivably be interpreted as 'despite the countess' —contrary to the countess’ wishes—but this seems unlikely, since Marie and Ortensia Stella were on good terms. Presumably, Marie is expressing the idea that the countess was aware of the order and perhaps had some hand in it."
